Keylog is a key tracking application for Residence Life Operations.  It is
intended to be a web-based database-backed app that replaces the disparate
Excel spreadsheets and facility use across desktops, virtual environments, etc.

This app uses Python and web.py for serving the web requests, SQLite (currently)
as the database, and relies heavily on jQuery-datatables and jQuery-datatables-editable
for the front-end functionality.
